# merge-lang specification (draft)

Status: draft before milestone M0. `merge-lang` is a working name.

Fill each section. The quoted line under each heading says what to write
there. Delete the quoted line when the section is complete.

## 1. Purpose

> Write here: what one program describes, what the compiler checks, and what
> it writes. Name the host and the target. Say that the core types and core
> operations are only those of `design/DESIGN.md`.

merge-lang is a language for <the domain>. Its type formers are F1 to F15 of
`formers/FORMERS.md`. Its core data types and core operations are only the
types and operations of `design/DESIGN.md` (the design).

## 2. Programs

A program is a UTF-8 file with a sequence of declarations. The surface is
Agda-like (Q7 (a), USER ruling 2026-10-25). Each operation has one
canonical form. `langc fmt FILE` prints the canonical text (section 2.6).

### 2.1 Declarations

A definition is a signature line and a clause line:

```
twice : (f : ℕ → ℕ) → ℕ → ℕ
twice f x = f (f x)
```

The clause starts with the name of the signature above it. If the names
are not the same, or if a clause has no signature, the parser gives
`PARSE_CLAUSE_NAME`. Each name after the clause name is a bare binder:
`f x y = t` is the same term as `f = λ x y → t`. The clause `f = λ x → t`
parses, and `fmt` prints it as `f x = t`. An annotated lambda
`λ (x : A) → t` is a different term, and `fmt` keeps it.

The domain file (`domain/domain.lang`) can also use these forms:

```
rec name : T
name x = t

postulate name : T

data Lot (size : ℕ) : Type where
  makeLot : (lotPrice : ℕ) → Lot size
```

- `rec` before a signature marks a recursive definition.
- `postulate` gives a name and a type with no definition.
- `data` declares a data type, with zero or more parameter groups. Each
  constructor is on its own line in the block. A constructor type must end
  in the data type applied to its parameters in order, then its result
  indices. A cell signature can also have a constructor of type
  `Path T s t`, where `T` is the family at its parameters and `s`, `t`
  are point terms. If the result has neither form, or
  if a field has no name, the parser gives `PARSE_CTOR_RESULT`. Each named
  Pi binder of a constructor type is a field: `(itemPrice : ℕ)` gives the
  field `itemPrice`.
- `codata` declares a cofamily (S2c). The block has one clause. The
  clause name is the corecursor, and the clause fields are the
  observation and the fields of the cofamily:
  `corec : (head : A) → (tail : Stream A) → Stream A`. Each field name is
  a destructor with an explicit type argument: `head ℕ s`, `tail ℕ s`.
  `corec A S h t s` gives the stream of the seed `s : S`. The parser takes
  more than one clause; the checker refuses it.

The compiler refuses these forms in a program: `data` with no type
argument (`REFUSE_DATA`, rule R2), `data` with a type argument that is not
a cell signature and `codata` that is not a cocell signature
(`REFUSE_CELL`, rule R1), `postulate` (`REFUSE_AXIOM`),
and `rec` or a reference to the same or a later definition (`REFUSE_REC`,
rule R3). It also refuses a declaration that uses a core name, a domain
name, the reserved word `Text` or a name that is already declared
(`REFUSE_NAME`). Thus a program cannot add a base type, an unproved fact
or general recursion. Recursion comes only from
`fold` (F6). The compiler writes the target; a program cannot.

`Fin` is a core name (S2d). `Fin n` is the Sigma
`(k : ℕ) × Path Bool (natLe (natAdd k 1) n) true`. A term of `Fin n` is
`pack k refl`, and `witness x` gives the `ℕ`. A message prints the Sigma,
not `Fin n`. S2d removed the kit names `Sum`, `inl`, `inr` and `either`:
they give `NAME_UNKNOWN` with the hint "use Option or a base sum".

### 2.2 Grammar

Application binds tighter than `∧`, then `∨`, then `×`, then `→`.
The binary operators nest to the right. The operand of `~` is one atom
(or another negation); as an application argument, a negation needs
parentheses: `f (~ i)`.

```
decl   := 'postulate' NAME ':' term
        | 'rec'? NAME ':' term NAME NAME* '=' term
        | 'data' NAME group* ':' (app '→')* 'Type' 'where' ctor+
        | 'codata' NAME group* ':' 'Type' 'where' ctor+
ctor   := NAME ':' term
group  := '(' NAME+ ':' term ')'
term   := 'λ' (NAME | group)+ '→' term
        | prod ('→' term)?
prod   := group '→' term | group '×' prod | join ('×' prod)?
join   := meet ('∨' join)?
meet   := app ('∧' meet)?
app    := prefix atom*
prefix := '~' prefix | atom
atom   := NAME | NAT | 'Type' NAT | '(' term ')' | '[' cells? ']'
cells  := term '↦' term (',' term '↦' term)*
```

A NAME starts with an ASCII letter or `_`. The next characters are ASCII
letters, digits, `_` or `'`. The symbol `ℕ` is the name of the natural
numbers. A NAT is a decimal numeral from 0 to 2^64-1 (`LEX_NAT_RANGE` if
it is larger). The keywords are `rec`, `postulate`, `data`, `codata`,
`where`, `Type`, `fun` and `Sigma`. The non-ASCII symbols are `→`, `λ`,
`×`, `ℕ`, `∧`, `∨` and `↦`; any other non-ASCII character outside a
comment gives `LEX_CHAR`.

### 2.3 Spellings and ASCII aliases

The grammar uses the canonical spellings. The parser also reads the ASCII
aliases in this table. An alias gives the same term as its canonical form.
`langc check` gives `W_NONCANON` on the first declaration that is not in
canonical form, with the canonical text as `fix` (O14). `fmt` prints only
the canonical spellings.

| Term | Canonical spelling | ASCII alias |
|---|---|---|
| Pi | `(x : A) → B`, `A → B` | `->` for `→` |
| Lambda | `λ x → t`, `λ (x : A) → t` | `\` for `λ`; `fun x => t` |
| Sigma | `(x : A) × B`, `A × B` | `*` for `×`; `Sigma (x : A) B` |
| Natural numbers | `ℕ` | `Nat` |
| Universe | `Type n` | none |

The core names do not change: `ℕ` and `Nat` give the one core name `Nat`.
The value printer of `langc eval` and diagnostic messages use these
canonical symbols too. A normal form can expand an abbreviation, such as
`Fin n` to its Sigma or `Path` to `PathP`. The printer can keep successive
lambdas separate; `fmt` merges their binders.

### 2.4 Layout rule

The surface has no keyword at the start of a definition, and an
application continues across lines. Thus the parser uses the columns:

- A declaration starts at column 1.
- A token that is the first token on its line, at a column less than or
  equal to the stop column, ends the current term (as the end of the file
  does). At the top level, the stop column is 1. Thus a term that continues
  on the next line must start that line at column 2 or more.
- In a `data` block, the first constructor sets the constructor column c
  (more than 1). A token at the start of a line at column c starts the next
  constructor. A token at the start of a line at a column less than c ends
  the block.
- A column counts code points, not bytes. `→` is one column.

### 2.5 Comments

A comment starts with `--` and continues to the end of the line. `fmt`
never drops a comment. In canonical form, each comment is a full line:

- A comment above a declaration is directly above it, with no blank line.
- A comment after the last declaration comes after one blank line.
- `fmt` moves an end-of-line comment, or a comment inside a declaration, to
  its own line above that declaration. `langc check` gives `W_NONCANON` for
  that input.

### 2.6 Canonical layout (`langc fmt`)

`langc fmt FILE` parses the file and prints the canonical text on stdout
(exit 0). A lex or parse error prints the diagnostic (exit 1). `fmt` does
not type-check. The canonical text has these properties:

- One line for each signature, each clause and each constructor. A
  constructor line starts with two spaces. `fmt` does not wrap a line.
- One blank line between declarations. No blank at the end of a line. The
  file ends in one newline.
- Only the canonical spellings of section 2.3.
- Parentheses only where the grammar needs them: a Pi, a Sigma or a lambda
  in a Pi domain or on the left of `×`, and an argument that is not an
  atom. For example, `(ℕ → ℕ) → ℕ` keeps its parentheses.
- One lambda for adjacent binders: `λ x y → t`, and
  `λ (g : ℕ → ℕ) (x : ℕ) → t`.
- One binder for each Pi: `(a k : ℕ) → ℕ` prints as
  `(a : ℕ) → (k : ℕ) → ℕ`.
- A definition whose body is a chain of bare-binder lambdas prints as a
  clause with arguments.

`langc check` compares the input with the canonical text one region at a
time. A region is the text from the end of the last line of the previous
declaration to the end of the last line of this declaration. The first
region that is not the same as its canonical text gives `W_NONCANON`. The
end of the file is the last region.

## 3. Type formers

> Write here: only the deviations from the formers. Do not copy the forms.
> Give each former whose status in `formers/tcc-wasm.md` is not DONE, and the
> open item (section 9) that records it.

The type formers are F1 to F15 of `formers/FORMERS.md`. This language uses
the tcc-wasm column of the realization matrix. `formers/tcc-wasm.md` gives
the host form of each former.

| ID | Status on tcc-wasm | Effect on this language | Open item |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |

## 4. Structures

> Write here: the carriers of Monad (F5), fold and unfold (F6, F7) and
> filter (F8) that the design uses. Name each carrier that the host does not
> give.

- **Monad**: `pure`, `map`, `bind` on <carriers>.
- **Algebra**: `fold` on <carriers>. `unfold` on <carriers>, or the reason
  that there is no `unfold`.
- **Filterable**: `filter` on <carriers>.

## 5. Core types

> Write here (DOMAIN SLOT): only the types of `design/DESIGN.md`. Give each
> type its meaning in the design and its definition in host forms. Mark each
> definition that a probe fact forces with "probe-forced".

| Type | Meaning (design section) | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| | | |

## 6. Core operations

> Write here (DOMAIN SLOT): only the operations of `design/DESIGN.md`. Give
> each operation its type and its meaning in the design.

| Operation | Type | Meaning (design section) |
|---|---|---|
| | | |

## 7. Target and instance encoding

> Write here: what the compiler writes. For a JSON target, give the instance
> rule and the encoding table. For a contract target, give the storage, the
> entries and the guards. Say how each proof erases.

An instance is a top-level definition whose type is a data type (F14).

| Type | Encoding |
|---|---|
| | |

## 8. Host and target

> Write here: the host, its pinned commit (`PIN`), the facts from
> `probe/CAPABILITY.md` that set the design, and the check that the compiler
> runs on its output (for example the axiom report).

## 9. Open items

> Write here: one item for each open question. Number the items O1, O2 and
> so on. Mark each decision as "RULED YYYY-MM-DD (USER): <the ruling>". Mark
> each fact that a probe found as "Probe-forced".

- O1. <question>.

## 10. Milestones

> Write here: the content of each milestone, and a dated status line under
> the current milestone.

| Milestone | Content |
|---|---|
| M0 | Host probe (`probe/CAPABILITY.md`); the core types construct and check; refusal list; examples and tests |
| M1 | Core operations |
| M2 | Queries and reads, or the contract |
| M3 | Hardening: speed, limits, a checked certificate for the output |
